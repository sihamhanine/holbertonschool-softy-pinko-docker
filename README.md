# holbertonschool-softy-pinko-docker
Project Overview
This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with Docker and Docker Compose. It focuses on creating, deploying, and scaling a full-stack application using Docker containers. The project covers aspects such as setting up front-end, back-end, proxy servers, and implementing horizontal scaling. Completed after the holberton v2 curriculum was implemented while tutoring.

Tasks and Implementation
Task 0: Create Your First Docker Image
Directory: task0
Objective: Create a Docker image based on Ubuntu, update and upgrade software, and echo "Hello, World!" on run.
Task 1: Back-end
Directory: task1
Objective: Modify Dockerfile to install Python3, pip3, and Flask. Set up a Flask server that returns "Hello, World!" on a specific endpoint.
Task 2: Front-end
Directory: task2
Objective: Set up a front-end environment using Nginx for static content hosting. Configure Nginx to serve the cloned Softy Pinko front-end.
Task 3: Connecting the Front-end and Back-end
Directory: task3
Objective: Link the front-end to the back-end to display dynamic data. Implement CORS in Flask and modify the front-end to request data from the back-end.
Task 4: Making it Simpler with Docker Compose
Directory: task4
Objective: Utilize Docker Compose to manage the multi-container setup. Include services for front-end, back-end, and proxy in the docker-compose.yml file.
Task 5: Proxy Server
Directory: task5
Objective: Set up an Nginx proxy server to route requests to the front-end and back-end. Modify the application to route all traffic through the proxy server.
Task 6: Scale Horizontally
Directory: task6
Objective: Implement horizontal scaling by running multiple instances of the API server. Configure load balancing using Nginx.
